# AI Tools Usage and Design Decisions

## AI Tools Used

### Lovable AI Editor
- **Primary tool**: Used for complete application development, component creation, and code generation
- **How it helped**: 
  - Generated the entire React application structure with TypeScript
  - Created component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Implemented API integration with React Query for caching
  - Generated responsive UI components using shadcn/ui
  - Provided best practices for React hooks and state management

## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Component-based approach**: Created separate components for SearchBar, SportFilter, LeagueCard, SeasonBadgeModal, and LoadingSpinner
- **Custom hooks**: Implemented useLeagues and useSeasons hooks for API data fetching
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and better development experience

### UI/UX Design
- **Clean card-based layout**: Modern sports platform aesthetic similar to DraftKings/FanDuel
- **Responsive grid**: Adapts from 1 column on mobile to 4 columns on desktop
- **Hover effects**: Cards scale and show shadow on hover for better interactivity
- **Loading states**: Proper loading spinners and error handling
- **Modal for season badges**: Clean popup to display season information

### Technical Choices
- **React Query**: For API caching and state management (5min cache for leagues, 10min for seasons)
- **shadcn/ui**: For consistent, accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React**: For consistent iconography

### Performance Optimizations
- **Response caching**: Implemented to avoid repeat API calls as requested
- **Memoized filtering**: Uses useMemo for efficient search and filtering
- **Image error handling**: Graceful fallback when season badges fail to load

## Time Management
The application was developed with focus on:
1. Core functionality first (API integration, filtering, search)
2. Clean component architecture
3. Responsive design
4. Error handling and loading states
5. Visual polish with hover effects and animations

The modular structure allows for easy extension and maintenance.
